# dinnergetter
My continued development of the "Dinner Getter" project started by myself, Daniel Soots, Brandon Hansen, and Sam Pattison.

The project helps with various aspects of procuring dinner options, including:
- Looking up recipes based on ingredients that you have on hand
- Getting the list of ingredients that you are still missing from these recipes
- Adding any missing ingredients to your shopping list with the click of a button
- Adding manually-entered ingredients to your shopping list
- Re-ordering your shopping list with a click-and-drag interface
- Entering "store mode" on your shopping list, designed to help manage your list while you are at the grocery

The back end of the application is written in Java, and connected to a React front end via a RESTful API.
